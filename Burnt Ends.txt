Take a brisket point and cut all the outside fat off. I then make the point so it is a uniform thickness. Rub with a yellow mustard and coat pretty heavily with your favorite beef rub. Let it sit for a few hours in the fridge to sweat. Get your cooker up to 275 degrees and place your points on for three hours. Remove and on a double layer of hd foil place the point, three slices of butter, brown sugar and a strong Au jus (about 4oz) and rightly seal it. Place back on the cooker for an hour to an hour and a half. Remove. Pour the foil juice into a fat separator and reserve it. Cut the point into even 1” or bigger cubes. Place in pan. Take the foil juice and mix equal part sweet sauce (I used Blues Hog Competition Blend) and pour over cubes. Toss to evenly cover. Cover foil pan tightly with aluminum foil and place back onto cooker for 45 minutes to an hour. Remove and enjoy.
